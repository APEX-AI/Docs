# APEX - Technical Whitepaper

# An intelligence system for creating distributed applications
Bitcoin and Ethereum mark an important evolution in computer science.  You wouldn't say this five years ago, but today it's not hard to imagine blockchain technology being just as transformative as the internet itself.  Decentralized computing made possible by distributed consensus will propel nacient systems to evolve at an exponential pace.  

APEX represents an evolution in the blockchain ecosystem whereby a present and evolving intelligence system will determine the best course for creation, distribution and redemption of smart tokens.  In practice, APEX is an extension to a smart contract that adds basic protocols for introspection into token economies for the purpose of creating artificially intelligent systems.

In addition to protocols, the APEX AI known as Xepa combines NLP, machine learning and deep learning to enable the creation of smart contracts and the transfer and redemption of tokens through text and voice.  

"Xepa, please send 20 BTC to Satoshi Nakamoto as a thank you for creating the blockchain."  

"Xepa, I'd like a create a contract for Katy Perry to offer merchandise to her fans." 
- Xepa replies "Great!, how many fans does Katy Perry have on Instagram?". 

"Xepa, I'd like to create a conract for my office to pool money for lunch."  
Xepa replies - "Great, how many people are hungry and how much does everyone spend on lunch?"  

The rest of this document assumes a working knowledge of blockchain, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and subsets of AI such as NLP, machine-learning and deep-learning.

### Background
Smart contracts were originally proposed by Nick Szabo in 1996 when the Internet was gaining mass adoption. [Smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) are a set of promises, specified in digital form, that include protocols within which parties perform on these promises [<sup>[1]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract#cite_note-:2-1) 

Smart contracts are one piece of a decentralized applications such as Ethereum.  [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language used to create smart contracts. 

[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) as a science dates back to 1956 with a multitude of disciplines spawning in thousands of directions since then.

### Artificial Intelligence
Consider the following.  The promise of AI is out of this world and yet hardly recognizable.  Most systems have yet to capture value from machine learning, deep learning, NLP and the like.  Cryptocurrency has shown to be effetive in capturing value for open source projects specificially Bitcoin and Ethereum.  APEX will take this knowledge and apply it in a specific manner.

Scientists who develop AI are providing a valuable resource from which value can be extracted.

### The AI solution
Defining the problem.  Where Ethereum is solving a technical problem known as "distributed consensus" most AI systems don't have a technical problem.  Consider an autonomous driving car.  The problem is the car doesn't know how do anything to start with.  The solution is clear as day.  Get from point A to point B, stay on the road, don't hit anyone.  AI in this case is coming up with a technical answer to a non-technical challenge.

#### Philosophy
We are well beyond questioning if a machine can [act intelligently] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence). Our intent of introducing philosophy is to take into account a deeper examination of our humanity to establish rules that govern a system that creates another system.

Our first rule is empathy.  Here's why.


#### Empathy
Empathy is a relatively new development in AI as stated by the Kairos article by Gabriella Leone [What is Empathy?] (https://www.kairos.com/blog/empathy-in-ai-series-part-1-what-is-empathy).  Aside from the buisiness application such as for chat bots for Mental Health, empathy is of far greater importance to an application tasked at creating other applications.  An average application would resemble something like Wall-e from Disney and at the extereme an empathetic terminator would be more like Dexter.  It is our position that all AI systems should employ empathy so they take into account the positive and potentially adverse effects of their actions.







# Overview
APEX looks to add introspection to the blockchain specifically to the distribution and redemption of digital tokens where the actors exchange value for consideration.

# Xepa - The smart contract bot

## Xepa Techniques
### NLP
Xepa can speak and perform basic actions

### Deep reinforcement learning


### Algorithm Injection
The APEX AI known as Xepa is a shell that accepts protocols injections from algorithm architects.  In laymans terms XEPA can be thought of as an algorythm choosing mechanism that is loosely coupled to the algorithm itself.  Any particular algorythm can be injected into any smart contract at the time of creation or later on.

### Model Determination
A contract model is a fully-formed set of protocol paramaters with a given orientation.  An algorithm match is made when an algorythm with a simulation score of 78 or better matches the input paramaters for a new smart contract.  A "parameter" match will always be selected before a "close" match because it's impossible to weight the missing paramater given a particual ecosystem.

### Model Evolution
A model may evolve over time and in a fashion similar to git-hub may be rolled backwards or forwards.  This is different than remodeling.  Remodeling occurs when a system consistently fails to uphold model standards or thresholds.

### Algorithm Architects
Architects are paid in AIT when their algorythms match a set of inputs to create a smart contract.  This "match" is the output of the algorythm in the form of a smart contract with accompanying protocols.


# Protocols

### create()
Recommend smart contracts based on capital needs & market demand

#### sample create()


### send()
Optimize placement opportunities for token distribution

#### sample send()


### redeem()
Maximize token economics through token consideration introspection

#### sample redeem()


# Protocol Paramaters
Protocol paramaters are an array of key-value pairs.
[{key:value}]




# Actors (aid - APEX Identity)

Protocols can combine identities cross-sandbox through the use of a aid.  Specific identities can be useful when identifying identity groups, brands and tastemakers.  APEX will assign aid's to actors when available. 

Usually a protocol will reference an identity group.  The group has it's own unique AID.  Multiple AID's can be used as parameters without exception.  XEPA will define a subset of identity groups to start with.  [Identity Groups](https://www.doapex.com)

New actors can be added through the add_actor() protocol


# Consideration (aic - APEX Consideration)

Protocols will always have a reference to consideration.  Consideration is the actual item or service being exchanged for a token.  

Similar to identities, considerations can be grouped.  The group has it's own unique AIC.  Multiple AIC's can be used as parameters without exception.  XEPA will define a subset of consideration groups to start with.  [Consideration Groups](https://www.doapex.com)

New consideration can be added through the add_consideration() protocol


# Actual Value (aiv - APEX Value)

Protocols will contain references to an actual value for an item of consideration in any fiat or token currency.  The value at the time of a transaction will change overtime thus it's important to perform any fiat exchange operations and store them at the time of transaction.

Similar to identities, considerations can be grouped. Usually a protocol will reference an identity group.  The group has it's own unique AID.  Multiple AID's can be used as parameters without exception.  

New values can be added through the add_value() protocol
