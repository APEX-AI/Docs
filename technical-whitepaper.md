# Buttrfly

## Abstract
Buttrfly is a decentralized messaging system for brands, influencers and tastemakers built on the EOS blockchain. Our platform coordinates and transacts with tens of millions of influencers to reach unprecedented scale. Buttrfly’s AI connects the world’s premier fashion, beauty and entertainment brands with the most engaging influencers to execute their campaigns. 


## Background
In 2006 a major technology company purchased the first sponsored tweet for $10,000. A young entrepreneur understood the power of her voice and who was listening and devised a business model to monetize her influence. The constructs of influencer marketing are based on the understanding that people are more likely to trust a recommendation given by someone they know; personalization and intimacy have become important to consumers in the age of the internet and brands have started to adapt the way they communicate with us.

Influencer marketing exploded in the last few years as a result of the exponential growth of social networks. As of 2017, daily social media usage of global internet users aged 16-64 amounted to 135 minutes per day [3]. consumers’ decisions are heavily swayed by their peers recommendations. Unprecedented adoption of social platforms like Instagram and YouTube established the ideal intimate environment for brands to speak directly to their consumers. With 49% of consumers relying on purchase recommendations from influencers and 74% of consumers using social networks prior to making purchase decisions, influencer marketing is positioned as the most effective form of digital advertising [4]. 

Brands acknowledge the effectiveness of influencer marketing campaigns as social media ad spending represented 16% of all digital ad spending globally in 2017 [2]. Ad spending is being reallocated to from traditional forms of advertising to influencer marketing campaigns as social influence continues to prove its power to sway purchasing decisions and strengthen brand identity. Last year influencer marketing spend reached $2 billion where 1.2M digital influencers endorsed over 12K brands, and this is just the beginning [5]. Influencer marketing spend is projected to grow to 10x in the next two years reaching $20 billion by 2020 [6].

As advertisers pour more of their annual budget into influencer marketing campaigns both brands and influencers need more support than what is currently offered by multi-channel influencer networks. Buttrfly is here to help both sides of the marketplace scale 10x in only two years.  


## Platform
Buttrfly implements AI for smart contract protocols that are executed on [EOS](https://eos.io/), which is designed to enable high throughput and highly scalable decentralized applications. We have the potential to scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees and allows for quick and easy deployment of our ubiquitous de-centralized application. 


## Human Understandable General AI
Buttrfly’s parent company APEX Smart Contracts Inc is the thought leader in Smart Contact Based Artificial Intelligence. Buttrfly is the first marketplace and implementation of this particular form of AI.

APEX protocols work as part of a three-part system. A neural net paired and Monty Carlo simulation with output to a unique polygon clustering model where language is assigned and visualized.

The difference between APEX and Google’s DeepMind (a neural net - Monte Carlo simulation hybrid) is the output model to a multi-dimensional polygon architecture whereby associations are visualized and the distance between nodes is meaningful and easily understood.

A complex neural network Diagram A uses hidden layers to simulate connections between neurons in a human brain. Increasing the number of layers leads to an exponentially growing number of abstractions.

It’s proven that General AI can be useful to draw conclusions & solve infinitely complex problems.  We want to introduce a system whereby language will explain said drawn conclusions method and teach us how the problem is being solved.  APEX contains a simulation engine connected to real-world human influence (Buttrfly) to output a polygon based model that accurately assigns language to each connection. _Diagram B_ > _Diagram C_

The neural net assigns weight to each connection.  The resulting output assumes a cohesive distance based on this weight.  Using polymath we can evenly and accurately display the resulting connections.

## Buttrfly
Buttrfly is a decentralized messaging system for brands, influencers and tastemakers built on the EOS blockchain. Buttrfly programmatically coordinates and transacts influencer marketing programs by establishing fair and transparent value metrics, exchanging that value using a unique token, and providing unbiased attribution and effectiveness measures to brands and influencers. 
 
Buttrfly is queryable and accessible through web services in a variety of ways. Specifically, you can purchase influence with BUC’s through a deep network of influencers in a broad array of categories.

The concept behind Buttrfly is simple:
Allow brands and influencers to interact and facilitate the exchange of value within a transparent online marketplace that uses the same data set on both sides of any transaction.

Buttrfly solves challenges on both sides of the transaction.

For brands, Buttrfly provides a view of a wide selection of influencers across multiple lifestyle verticals, data that indicates the relative value of an influencer for specific tasks or programs, direct lines of communication with influencers, and the ability to pre-book activities at discounts to current market values.

For influencers, Buttrfly provides a platform to present themselves to global brand marketers in an accurate and efficient manner, highlight specific activities and tasks that they are interested in performing, find opportunities to engage with brands, and pre-sell their own “inventory” thereby giving them more predictable income over time.

More importantly Buttrfly allows our AI to get into the wild and be optimised as we build for other marketplaces.


## Buttrfly Protocols

# send()
An extension to send() on EOS params:
- to
- value
- to_whom
- from_whom
- for_what

# Actors (aid - APEX Identity)
Protocols can combine identities cross-sandbox through the use of a aid. Specific identities can be useful when identifying identity groups, brands and tastemakers. APEX will assign aid's to actors when available. 

Usually a protocol will reference an identity group. The group has its own unique AID. Multiple AID's can be used as parameters without exception. New actors can be added through the add_actor() protocol.

# Consideration (aic - APEX Consideration)
Protocols will always have a reference to consideration. Consideration is the actual item or service being exchanged for a token.

Similar to identities, considerations can be grouped. The group has its own unique AIC. Multiple AIC's can be used as parameters without exception. New consideration can be added through the add_consideration() protocol.

# Actual Value (aiv - APEX Value)
Protocols will contain references to an actual value for an item of consideration in any fiat or token currency. The value at the time of a transaction will change overtime thus it's important to perform any fiat exchange operations and store them at the time of transaction.

Similar to identities, considerations can be grouped. Usually a protocol will reference an identity group. The group has its own unique AID. Multiple AID's can be used as parameters without exception.

New values can be added through the add_value() protocol.
