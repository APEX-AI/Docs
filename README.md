# APEX
APEX represents an evolution in the blockchain ecosystem whereby a present and evolving intelligence system will determine the best course for creation, distribution and redemption of smart tokens.

APEX defines the structure for the implementation of Xepa protocols into token marketplaces.  

# Xepa - The Smart Contract Bot

# APEX Concepts
APEX can technically be defined as participatory token economics with an introspective deep-learning protocol.  Placement, actors, capitalization and redemption themes are consistently seen throughout the APEX ecosystem.  

## Placement
Simply put, the buyers of tokens

## Capitalization
How many tokens were sold

## Redemption
The specific consideration were tokens used for

## Actors
Profiles for buyers and seller

# APEX Protocols
Protocols are described in the [Technical Whitepaper](https://github.com/apex-ai/proto/blob/master/technical-whitepaper.md)
