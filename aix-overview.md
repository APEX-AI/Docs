# Overview

The Apex Influencer Exchange (AIX) is a data-driven marketplace on the Blockchain that allows brands and influencers to interact to conceive and execute influencer marketing programs, establish fair and transparent value metrics, exchange that value using a unique token, and provide unbiased attribution and effectiveness measures.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Influencer Marketing, while certainly not new—some date the first influencer marketing campaign to 1760 when the Wedgwood China Company sought royal endorsement to build their brand—has taken on a whole new importance in the modern media marketplace.

In 2017 it is estimated that marketers will spend over $1 billion on influencer marketing campaigns in the US alone, and the importance of this channel is estimated to continue growing at a double-digit pace.

Macro trends driving this phenomenon include the growing use of ad blockers, social connectivity of the Millennial and Zentinnial audience, and the sheer volume of marketing messages that the average consumer sees every day.

Trusted voices that have a true affinity to products and services play an important role in the purchase decisions of millions of consumers around the world.

And it’s not just the famous the help drive affinity and action.

There is a growing awareness and acceptance of the importance of influencers across the continuum of celebrity in helping consumers make informed decisions.

While “Macro Tier 1 Influencers” along the lines of a Kanye West or a Katy Perry can impact millions of people, very often a favorable recommendation from a close friend on their Instagram feed will have a more profound effect on a small group of people.

Today, the marketplace for brands and influencers to interact and engage is fragmented, high-touch, people intensive and difficult to manage.

For brands, challenges include understanding what type of programs actually work, identifying the right influencers for a campaign, determining what kind of action will be the most effective, planning the right mix of media, negotiating with the influencer to reach a fair deal, and then ensuring that the campaign is executed as planned.

For influencers, particularly below the Macro Tier 1 level, challenges include unpredictable demand for their services, establishing their value in the marketplace, making themselves available to brands for specific programs or activities, and continuing to build the value of their social presence with brands with whom they have true affinity.

The concept behind AIX is simple:

Allow brands and influencers to interact and facilitate the exchange of value within a transparent online marketplace that uses the same data set on both sides of any transaction.

AIX solves challenges on both sides of the transaction.

For brands, AIX provides a view of a wide selection of influencers across multiple lifestyle verticals, data that indicates the relative value of an influencer for specific tasks or programs, direct lines of communication with influencers, and the ability to pre-book activities at discounts to current market values.

For influencers, AIX provides a platform to present themselves to global brand marketers in an accurate and efficient manner, highlight specific activities and tasks that they are interested in performing, find opportunities to engage with brands, and pre-sell their own “inventory” thereby giving them more predictable income over time.
